Angry Birds, a wildly popular mobile game developed by Rovio Entertainment, first debuted in 2009 and quickly became a global phenomenon. The game features a group of multicolored birds with different abilities who are seeking revenge on green pigs that have stolen their eggs. Players use a slingshot to launch the birds at the pigs' various structures, aiming to knock them down and achieve high scores.

The game's success can be attributed to its simple yet addictive gameplay, charming characters, and clever level design. Angry Birds has expanded beyond its original mobile platform, with versions available on various devices, including consoles and computers. The franchise has also expanded into merchandise, animated series, and even a feature film.

While Angry Birds is renowned for its fun and engaging experience, it has faced criticism for its addictive nature and potential to distract users. Nevertheless, its impact on mobile gaming and pop culture is undeniable, leaving an enduring legacy in the world of casual gaming.
